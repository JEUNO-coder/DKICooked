# DonkeyKongInf

A 2D platformer prototype built with **libGDX**.  
This project focuses on custom player physics, collision resolution, and clean separation between rendering, input, and physics.

## Status
**Work in progress**  
Core movement and collision systems are actively being developed and refactored.

## Features (current)
- Custom player physics (acceleration, friction, gravity)
- Charge-based jump system
- Solid platform collision (ground, ceiling, side hits)
- Fixed-timestep physics update
- Debug rendering using ShapeRenderer

## Controls
- **A / D** — Move left / right  
- **Space** — Hold to charge jump, release to jump

## Tech Stack
- Java
- libGDX
- Scene2D
- Gradle

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
3. Run the `DesktopLauncher` configuration
